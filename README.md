Secret Santa is a ***react-native*** application which allows users to send gifts to each other.

Upon sign up users are assigned a random person to send a gift to, they will then have to send a gift matching the given persons interests. Once they are ready to send the gift, they can view local drop off points on a map where they can send their gift from. After the gift has been received by the person the user will also be eligible to receive a gift. Upon receiving a gift from another user, they will have the ability to take a picture of and leave a review of the gift.

Additionally, users will be able to see the status (ready to send/sent/ ready to receive/ received) of the delivery. If they are struggling to come up with a gift idea, they can select a price range and get one randomly chosen from Amazon. There is also have a chat feature where you will be able to connect with users you have previously sent/received gift from.
